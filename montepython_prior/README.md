# Prior on absolute magnitude of supernovae for Pantheon

### Files

   - `Pantheon_and_M.param`
   - `absolute_M/__init__.py`
   - `absolute_M/absolute_M.data`

### Description
To include the absolute magnitude of Pantheon prior on your montepython installation you should paste `absolute_M` into the `likelihoods` folder doing:
```
cp -r absolute_M /path-to-your-montepython/montepython/likelihoods/

```
File `Pantheon_and_M.param` contains a naive example on how to use this prior along with the Pantheon likelihood. To update/change the prior on M just edit the file `absolute_M/absolute_M.data`. This current version correspond to `M_B = -19.2435 Â± 0.0373 mag` and should be only using with Pantheon supernovae.
